# TapticMusic Second Prototype

Second Prototype of TapticMusic.

This prototype was built when I was mentally fell apart.

Music and Haptic beat does not sync together on first try but does on second try.

# What happened to TapticMusic?

TapticMusic (Release, not this one) was released to the App Store, with completely different design,

but it ended up getting pulled due to many issues.

This will be replaced with upcoming tapAudio which uses more efficient algorithm.
